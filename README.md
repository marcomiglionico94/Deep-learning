# Deep-learning
This repository contains some Python programs that implement different Deep Learning techniques.
Some of the program has been done following the online course on udemy Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks:

In particular, right now the following programs are present:

* ANN Clients Bank:
   
   The programs is implemented in Python 3 using Tensorflow and Keras. The main goal is customer churn prediction in a Bank. The Hyperparameters optimization is done using GridSearch

* Cat-Dog CNN: 

   The programs is implemented in Python 3 using Tensorflow and Keras. We implemented a CNN able to recognize between Cats or Dogs in a picture

* LSTM Stock Price:
   The programs is implemented in Python 3 using Tensorflow and Keras. We implemented a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) for Google Stock Price Prediction

* SOM:

  The programs is implemented in Python 3 using MiniSom implementation. The program use Australian Credit Approval data to find frauds thanks using Self Organizing Maps
